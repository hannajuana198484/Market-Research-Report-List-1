<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Extensometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Extensometers</li><li>Non-contact Extensometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital extensometer market is categorized into two main types: contact extensometers and non-contact extensometers. Contact extensometers physically attach to the specimen, measuring deformation through direct physical interaction, making them ideal for precise strain measurements in laboratory settings. In contrast, non-contact extensometers utilize optical or laser technology to measure displacement without direct contact, allowing greater flexibility and reduced influence on the sample. Both types serve critical roles in material testing and structural monitoring across various industries.</p></p>
