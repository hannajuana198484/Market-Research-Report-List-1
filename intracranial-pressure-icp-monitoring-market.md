<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li><li>Non-invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intracranial Pressure (ICP) monitoring market is divided into two main types: invasive and non-invasive monitors. Invasive ICP monitors involve surgical placement of sensors within the cranial cavity, providing accurate and real-time pressure readings, often used in critical care settings. Non-invasive ICP monitors, on the other hand, use external methods such as transcranial Doppler or near-infrared spectroscopy to estimate intracranial pressure without the need for surgical intervention, appealing for less critical assessments and patient comfort. Both types serve vital roles in patient management.</p></p>
